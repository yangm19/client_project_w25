                <h3>Scope of services</h3>
                <p>
                    In support of the educational goals of the University and the Division of Student Life, Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides a range of clinical, preventative, and training services consistent with the practices and standards of a nationally accredited university counseling center. CAPS is committed to creating a safe and supportive environment based on our multicultural, multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical values and practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, to receive high quality services, and to take positive pathways to mental health.</p>
                    <h4>Clinical services:</h4>
                    <p>CAPS licensed therapists provide confidential clinical services for eligible U of M undergraduate and graduate students. Mental health therapy goes by different names including counseling, psychotherapy, talk therapy, and supportive counseling. It is a collaborative process between a client and counselor that begins with establishing a trusting and respectful relationship in a caring and nonjudgmental environment. Together the client and counselor explore the client’s concerns and develop mutually agreed upon goals for therapy. Some typical goals include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identifying and changing patterns of thinking or believing that hinder personal and academic success or create and maintain problem situations</li>
                        <li>Deepening understanding of oneself</li>
                        <li>Discovering and developing personal strengths</li>
                        <li>Developing or regaining a sense of control and pleasure in life</li>
                        <li>Developing or improving coping skills</li>
                        <li>Asking for help and support from friends, family, and other campus resources</li>
                        <li>Creating a greater understanding of oneself in relationships with others</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Crisis services:</h4>
                    <p>CAPS clinicians are available for students needing immediate, same-day access to a mental health professional during our business hours. Reasons to meet with a Counselor on Duty include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>If a student has been sexually assaulted within the past 72 hours</li>
                        <li>If a student has been experiencing a lot of stress for a long time and feels like they urgently need to speak to someone</li>
                        <li>If a student has experienced a sudden or unexpected loss</li>
                    </ul>
