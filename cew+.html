            <p>Through a variety of initiatives, groups, and lecture series, CEW+ lifts up and make space for diverse voices.</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial Empowerment Initiative | <a href="https://www.cew.umich.edu/financial-empowerment-initiative/">FEI</a></li>
                <p>The Financial Empowerment Initiative (FEI) is a series of workshops that teaches participants to understand the psycho-social and emotional factors impacting financial decision-making behaviors and the alignment of those behaviors with long-term goals.</p>
                <li>Supporting the Academic Excellence of Student Caregivers | <a href="https://www.cew.umich.edu/advocacy-initiatives/student-parents/">Student caregivers</a></li>
                <p>CEW+ has always served as an advocate for student caregivers. Early on the Center began tackling barriers to student parent enrollment and that work actively continues today. The reality is the identity of a student caregiver at U-M has never been simple or easy. Today CEW+ is focused on building collaborative work with student parents to create more systems-level change, removing barriers for student parents on their path to graduation.</p>
                <li>CEW+ Annual Advocacy Symposium | <a href="https://www.cew.umich.edu/advocacy-initiatives/cew-annual-advocacy-symposium/">Annual advocacy symposium</a></li>
                <p>CEW+ annually brings together staff, faculty, students, and community members to create change through introspection, dialogue, and action at our advocacy symposium. The goal is to give participants practical tools to better advocate for themselves and others. CEW+ seeks to encourage attendees to think about the many ways in which we can be activists as well as how we can support others in navigating the current systems that impact their life. </p>
                <li>CEW+ Scholar Community | <a href="https://www.cew.umich.edu/advocacy-initiatives/cew-scholar-community/">Scholar community</a></li>
                <p>The CEW+ Scholar Community consists of current and former CEW+ scholarship recipients (nearly 1800), and exists to support, inspire, and unleash the collective power of scholars and fellows to make a positive impact in their lives, in their communities, and in the world. With support from the Scholar Success Fund, the initiative launched and continues to build momentum.</p>
