            <h2>About Maize & Blue</h2>
            <p>The food pantry serves to ensure members of the University of Michigan community—whether on a tight budget or physically restrained from getting to a grocery store—receive equitable access to healthy, nutritious, and nourishing food and the ability to prepare it for themselves or others.
            </p>
